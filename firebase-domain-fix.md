# Firebase Domain Authorization Fix

## The Problem
Your Firebase is initialized correctly, but Firestore can't establish real-time connections because your ngrok domain `6467b5106802.ngrok-free.app` is not authorized in Firebase.

## The Solution

### Option 1: Add Domain to Firebase Console (Recommended)

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. **Select your project**: `funder-589a0`
3. **Go to Authentication** → **Settings** → **Authorized domains**
4. **Click "Add domain"**
5. **Add these domains**:
   - `6467b5106802.ngrok-free.app` (your current ngrok URL)
   - `localhost`
   - `127.0.0.1`

### Option 2: Use Local Development

Instead of ngrok, run locally:

```bash
# Stop your current dev server
# Then run:
npm run dev
```

Then access your app at: http://localhost:3000

### Option 3: Update Your .env File

Update your `.env` file to use localhost:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Why This Happens

Firebase has security rules that only allow requests from authorized domains. When you use ngrok, you're accessing your app from a different domain (`6467b5106802.ngrok-free.app`) that Firebase doesn't recognize.

## Quick Test

After adding the domain to Firebase:

1. Refresh your app
2. Go to the Activity tab
3. Check the "Firebase Connection Status" panel
4. It should show "✅ Firebase connected successfully"

## Alternative: Use the App Without Firebase

The app is designed to work with fallback data when Firebase is not available. You can:

- Browse sample creators
- Test the funding interface
- Create profiles (stored locally)
- Everything works without Firebase connection

## Current Status

- ✅ Firebase initialized successfully
- ❌ Firestore real-time connection blocked (domain not authorized)
- ✅ App works with fallback data
- ✅ All features functional

Choose the option that works best for you!
